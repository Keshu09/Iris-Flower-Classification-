Iris Flower Classification using Machine Learning

Iris flower classification is a classic problem in the field of machine learning, which involves predicting the species of iris flowers based on their physical characteristics. The dataset used for this problem is the Iris dataset, which consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, each with four features - sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The samples are labeled with the species of iris flower - Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica.
Machine learning algorithms such as decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines can also be used for iris flower classification. These algorithms work by building a model that can predict the class of a new sample based on the patterns and relationships between the features in the dataset.
